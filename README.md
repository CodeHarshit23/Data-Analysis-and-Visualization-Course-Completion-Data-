Description: 
This project explores and analyzes course completion data using Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key Objectives: 
1. Gain insights into learner behavior and trends.
2. Generate informative visualizations to communicate data effectively.
Methodology: 
1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the course completion data and perform necessary data cleaning steps (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversions).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and statistical analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.
3. Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as: Bar charts to visualize course completion rates, Line charts to track trends over time, Histograms to analyze learner demographics, Scatter plots to identify potential correlations.
4. Interpretation and Insights: Analyze the generated visualizations to identify key trends, patterns, and insights into learner behavior.

Technologies: 
1. Python
2. pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
